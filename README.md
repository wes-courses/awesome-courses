## Purpose

- **One stop shop for all things Wes (courses)**, with links to:
- **Upcoming WIP courses**
  - Small steppig stones with a git repo keeps me sane and helps you see step by step what is demonstrated so it's not just a final result!
- **Existing courses** and **materials**
  - **Public git repos** with:
  - Scripts, code, resource links, knowledge dumps, rants that didn't fit into the course, updates after release, etc 
- **Original editions** of updated courses
  - Some things don't make the cut when updating courses, such as when the goal is also to reduce duration during an update 
  - If you want access to what was cut 
  - OR if you're using an older version of software you might prefer to learn with a version that you're actually running in production. 
- **Future courses (potential)**
- **Got a course idea?** File a suggestion as an issue and let's discuss it. Contribute to open discussions and upvote what would be helpful. 
  - Let me know about my style, what works and doesn't work for you and why. And links to examples are really helpful. 
  
Enjoy!
